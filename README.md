**Objective**

The objective of the Password Strength Checker project is to provide a tool for evaluating the strength of user-entered passwords. It aims to enhance password security by assessing key factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness. This tool helps users create stronger, more secure passwords to protect their accounts and personal information.

**Key Activities**

1. Design and Implementation: Develop the algorithm to evaluate password strength based on length, complexity, and uniqueness.
2. Testing and Validation: Test the tool with various passwords to ensure accurate and reliable strength assessment.
3. User Interaction and Documentation: Create a user-friendly interface, provide clear feedback, and document the tool comprehensively.
   
**Technologies Used**

Java: The primary programming language used to develop the password strength checker.

Java Development Kit (JDK): Utilized for compiling and running the Java program.

Regular Expressions (Regex): Employed for validating the presence of different character types in passwords.
